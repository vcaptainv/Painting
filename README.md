# Painting

we learned how to create child class out of the parent class. In addition, we learned how to utilise dictionary, which makes a cleaner reference to the rules of our L-system. The first task is to create a tree class which is a child class of shape class. Then we need to write out a test function to draw the tree L-system out. Basically, L-system.txt file is first reader by lsystem.py file and then turtle interpreter will draw the graph according to l-system.
